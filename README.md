# Tech challenge 1

## Target
Register for an API key at https://openweathermap.org/and wait for your key to become active.\
Create an interface in pure HTML, CSS and TS (no frameworks except Redux, Chrome compatible browser with latest ECMAScript features) that takes a location as input and a button to query the above api and displays relevant information in a clean design. Include a README to explain how to test your code.\
This should take no more than 1-2 hours.\
Send us a link to a your github repo with the code.

## How to test
Run the following command to start the project
```cmd
npm start
```
